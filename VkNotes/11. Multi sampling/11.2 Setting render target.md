Since the back buffer is using multiple samples per pixel, it is not possible to directly display it on the screen. We will have to transition it to the `1_BIT_SAMPLE` frame buffer later on.

We will create addition render target that will support *mulitisampling*. We start by storing 3 new variables as a class members. Even though we are using multiple frames in flight this texture will only be used once during each render call.

```c++
VkImage m_colorImage;  
VkDeviceMemory m_colorImageMemory;  
VkImageView m_colorImageView;
```

Those newly created images will contain *n* number of samples. We will add additional field to the `ImageCreateInfo` struct to hold the desired amount of samples so that image creation can take that into account. 

```c++
VkImageTiling imageTiling = VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL;  
VkImageAspectFlags aspectFlag = VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT;  

VkSampleCountFlagBits sampleCount = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
```

We will use this field during image creation like so

```c++
VkImageCreateInfo imageInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO};
//...
imageInfo.samples = createImageInfo.sampleCount;
```

Now we will create function that will fill in the above created member variables. There we will use the retrieved maximum number of samples. This function will be called **before** we create resources for the depth buffer.

```c++
VkFormat format = FindDepthFormat();  
  
ImageCreateInfo imageInfo{};  
imageInfo.physicalDevice = m_physicalDevice;  
imageInfo.logicalDevice= m_device;  
imageInfo.surface = m_sruface;  
imageInfo.format = format;  
imageInfo.size = (m_swapChainExtent.width * m_swapChainExtent.height);  
imageInfo.width = m_swapChainExtent.width;  
imageInfo.height = m_swapChainExtent.height;  
imageInfo.imageTiling = VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL;  
imageInfo.usage = VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT;  
imageInfo.memoryProperteis = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT;  

CreateImage(imageInfo, m_depthImage, m_depthMemory);  
  
m_depthImageView = GenerateImageView(m_device, m_depthImage, 1,format, VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT);
```
