We will start by changing the render pass and inform it that we are using the multiple samples. Both for the colour and for the depth. 

```c++
VkAttachmentDescription colorAttachment{};  
colorAttachment.format = m_swapChainImageFormat;  
colorAttachment.samples = m_msaaSamples;
colorAttachment.finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;

VkAttachmentDescription depthAttachment{};  
//format should be the same as a depht image  
depthAttachment.format = FindDepthFormat();  
depthAttachment.samples = m_msaaSamples;
```

We have changed the `finalLayout` field to be `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` this is because multi sampled image can not be presented to the screen directly. We will have to create additional colour attachment that will resolve multi sampled images to the regular one, which can be presented on the screen. This is **not** required for the depth image as it will not be showed on the screen.

We will create **resolved attachment** that will be presented to the screen.

```c++
VkAttachmentDescription colorAttachmentResolve{};  
colorAttachmentResolve.format = m_swapChainImageFormat;  
colorAttachmentResolve.samples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;  
colorAttachmentResolve.loadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;  
colorAttachmentResolve.storeOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE;  
colorAttachmentResolve.stencilLoadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;  
colorAttachmentResolve.stencilStoreOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE;  
colorAttachmentResolve.initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED;  
colorAttachmentResolve.finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR;
```

Now we will create attachment reference that will point to `colorAttachemntResolve`, this attachment reference will be a resolve target.

```c++
VkAttachmentReference colorAttachmentResolveRef{};  
colorAttachmentResolveRef.attachment = 2;  
colorAttachmentResolveRef.layout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
```

Now we have to tell the subpass to resolve the multisample attachment to the regular attachment that is able to be presented to the screen. 

We will do it in the `VkSubpassDescription` struct by filling in the `pResolveAttachemnts` field

```c++
subPass.pResolveAttachments = &colorAttachmentResolveRef;
```

Now we will extend that array that informs `VkCreateRenderPassInfo` struct about the attachments that are going to be used by it. 

```c++
std::array<VkAttachmentDescription,3> attachemnts = {colorAttachment, depthAttachment, colorAttachmentResolve};
```

Last thing that remains is to inform the frame buffer itself and assign image views for the attachments that are described by the render pass 

```c++
for(size_t i=0; i<m_swapChainImageViews.size(); i++) {  
    std::array<VkImageView,3> attachments = {  
        m_swapChainImageViews[i],  
        m_depthImageView,  
        m_colorImageView  
    };  
    VkFramebufferCreateInfo frameBufferInfo{};  
    frameBufferInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FRAMEBUFFER_CREATE_INFO;  
    frameBufferInfo.renderPass = m_renderPass;  
    frameBufferInfo.attachmentCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(attachments.size());  
    frameBufferInfo.pAttachments = attachments.data();
```

And inform the graphics pipeline that we are going to be using multi sampling buffer. 
```c++
multisampleCreateInfo.rasterizationSamples = m_msaaSamples;
```
