Issue where rasterizer creates wobbly edges due to the samples. We will increase the number of samples that rasterizer is using per image to get better quality results.

We will be using the maximum available samples that GPU has to offer. This will provide better quality but worse performance.

We will start by querying maximum amount of available samples on the GPU and storing it to the class variable. 

```c++
VkSampleCountFlagBits m_msaaSamples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
```

Next we will query the available samples. Since we are using depth buffer as well we need to take that to the account and select maximum amount of samples that are supported for both depth buffer and colour buffer.

```c++

```
