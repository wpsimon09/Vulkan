Issue where rasterizer creates wobbly edges due to the samples. We will increase the number of samples that rasterizer is using per image to get better quality results.

We will be using the maximum available samples that GPU has to offer. This will provide better quality but worse performance.

We will start by querying maximum amount of available samples on the GPU and storing it to the class variable. 

```c++
VkSampleCountFlagBits m_msaaSamples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
```

Next we will query the available samples. Since we are using depth buffer as well we need to take that to the account and select maximum amount of samples that are supported for both depth buffer and colour buffer.

```c++
VkPhysicalDeviceProperties physicalDeviceProperties;  
vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(m_physicalDevice, &physicalDeviceProperties);
VkSamplerCreateFlags counts = physicalDeviceProperties.limits.framebufferColorSampleCounts  
&


if(counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_64_BIT){return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_64_BIT;}  
if(counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_32_BIT){return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_32_BIT;}  
if(counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_16_BIT){return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_16_BIT;}  
if(counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_8_BIT){return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_8_BIT;}  
if(counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_4_BIT){return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_4_BIT;}  
if(counts & VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_2_BIT){return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_2_BIT;}  
  
return VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;
```

Now we will use this function to retrieve the most available samples. During the creation of physical device.

```c++
//----------------------------------  
// PICK THE PHYSICAL DEVICE SUITABLE  
//----------------------------------  
for (auto &device: devices) {  
    if (isDeviceSuitable(device, m_sruface)) {  
        m_physicalDevice = device;  
        VkPhysicalDeviceProperties props;  
        m_msaaSamples = GetMaxUsableSampleCount();
```
