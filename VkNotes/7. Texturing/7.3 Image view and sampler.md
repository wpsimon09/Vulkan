In Vulkan images are accessed via `VkImageView` rather then directly. Our image is not exception, thus we have to crate image view for it.

We will create another helper function to create image view. We will use this function to also create swap chain image views.

```c++
VkImageView GenerateImageView(VkDevice logicalDevice,VkImage image, VkFormat format = VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_SRGB) {  
    VkImageViewCreateInfo viewInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_VIEW_CREATE_INFO};  
    viewInfo.image = image;  
    viewInfo.viewType = VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_2D;  
    viewInfo.format = format;  
    viewInfo.subresourceRange.aspectMask = VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT;  
    viewInfo.subresourceRange.baseMipLevel = 0;  
    viewInfo.subresourceRange.levelCount = 1;  
    viewInfo.subresourceRange.baseArrayLayer = 0;  
    viewInfo.subresourceRange.layerCount = 1;  
  
    VkImageView imgView;  
    if(vkCreateImageView(logicalDevice, &viewInfo, nullptr, &imgView) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
        throw std::runtime_error("Filed to create image views ");  
    }  
  
    return imgView;  
}
```

We of course have to clear the allocated resources

```c++
vkDestroyImageView(m_device, m_textureImageView, nullptr);  
vkDestroyImage(m_device, m_textureImage, nullptr);  
vkFreeMemory(m_device, m_textureImageMemory, nullptr);
```

## Samplers

Textures are accessed via sampler, they apply filtering and transformation to the image to retrieve and compute final colour.

When we have large geometry and take the colour that is closest to the sample point we would get pixelated result. When we take 4 closest samples and linearly interpolate between them we will get more smoother results. This is automatically preformed by the samplers which is why we will create them.

Additionally sampler also transforms the image when we want to access texels outside the image. This is done by configuring *addressing mode*

We will create texture sampler **after** we have created image views and texture images 

```c++
VkSamplerCreateInfo samplerInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SAMPLER_CREATE_INFO};  
samplerInfo.magFilter = VK_FILTER_LINEAR; //can be VK_FILTER_NEREAST (resutls in pixelatino)  
samplerInfo.minFilter = VK_FILTER_LINEAR; //can be VK_FILTER_NEREAST (resutls in pixelatino)  
samplerInfo.addressModeU = VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_REPEAT; // what happens when we attemp to sample where there are not pixels  
samplerInfo.addressModeV = VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_REPEAT; // can be repeat, clamp to eadge or clamp to border  
samplerInfo.addressModeW = VK_SAMPLER_ADDRESS_MODE_REPEAT;  
samplerInfo.anisotropyEnable = VK_TRUE;
```

The antistropy determines what happens when we oversamaple the image. It is number that can be request from physical device and we can go lower if we want better performance but lower image quality.

```c++
VkPhysicalDeviceProperties physicalDeviceProperties;  
vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties(m_physicalDevice, &physicalDeviceProperties);  Åˆ

samplerInfo.maxAnisotropy = physicalDeviceProperties.limits.maxSamplerAnisotropy;
```

Now we can finish filling in the struct.

```c++
//color to be used when VK_SAMPLER_ADRESSS_MODE_BORDER is selected  
samplerInfo.borderColor = VK_BORDER_COLOR_INT_OPAQUE_BLACK;  
  
// use uv coordinates in range (0,1) - true or (0,imageLimit) - false  
samplerInfo.unnormalizedCoordinates = VK_FALSE;  
  
// compare values against reference, this will be important while calculating PCF shadow  
samplerInfo.compareEnable = VK_FALSE;  
samplerInfo.compareOp = VK_COMPARE_OP_ALWAYS;  
  
// mip mapping  
samplerInfo.mipmapMode = VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_LINEAR;  
samplerInfo.mipLodBias = 0.0f; // can also be physicalDeviceProperties.limits.maxSamplerLodBias  
samplerInfo.minLod = 0.0; 
samplerInfo.maxLod = 0.0f; 
```

Now we can create the sampler and store it as a class member for future reference 

```c++
  
if(vkCreateSampler(m_device, &samplerInfo, nullptr, &textureSampler) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("failed to create texture sampler");  
}
```

> NOTE: The sampler is not referencing `VkImage` anywhere this is because it is stand alone object and can be used to reference any texture we want. Be it 2D, 1D or 3D.

Also we must not forget to destroy it after the image has been destroyed.

```c++
vkDestroyImageView(m_device, m_textureImageView, nullptr);  
vkDestroyImage(m_device, m_textureImage, nullptr);  
vkDestroySampler(m_device, m_textureSampler, nullptr);
```

## Enabling antystrophy

Since we are using antystrophy it is optional feature we have to request it from the physical device.

In `CreateLogicalDevice` function we have to request it. 

```c++
VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures deviceFeatures{};  
deviceFeatures.samplerAnisotropy = VK_TRUE;
```

We should also update the `isDeviceSuitable` function to select the device that actually has this feature. 

```c++

```
