Now we can copy the allocated data to the vertex buffer. This is done by first mapping the allocated GPU memory to the CPU memory. Using `vkMapMemory` function. We can than fill in this memory and send it back to the GPU which can be accessed by the Vertex shader.

```c++
void* data;  
vkMapMemory(m_device, m_vertexBufferMemory, 0, bufferInfo.size, 0, &data);
```

for the size we can also use `VK_WHOLE_SIZE` to get all memory available. 

Now we can use `memcpy` to simple copy the desired vertex information. And than un-map the memory using `vkUnmapMemory`.

```c++
void* data;  
vkMapMemory(m_device, m_vertexBufferMemory, 0, bufferInfo.size, 0, &data);  
    memcpy(data, vertices.data, (size_t)bufferInfo.size);  
vkUnmapMemory(m_device, m_vertexBufferMemory);
```

Sometimes driver might not copy the memory due to the reasons like caching or the writes are not visible at this point. To deal with this problem we have specified that we want to retrieve memory heap that is host coherent by passing `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT` to the `FindMemoryType` function. This ensures that the mapped memory *always* matches contents of the allocated memory.

Another approach is to call `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges` **after** writing to the mapped memory and than call `vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges` **before** reading from the mapped memory. 

Data is than send to the GPU during the next `vkQueueSubmit` command. 

## Binding vertex buffer

We have to bind the vertex buffer during rendering operations which is specified by recording the command buffer.
