It is used to not replicate the redundant vertices. We will use index to specify which vertices to draw where. OpenGL equivalent to this is `ElementBufferObject (EBO)` 

![[Index vs vertex buffer.png]]
We will start of by changing the vertices of the triangle to contain 4 corners 

```c++
const std::vector<Vertex> vertices = {  
    {{-0.5f, -0.5f}, {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}},  
    {{0.5f, -0.5f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}},  
    {{0.5f, 0.5f}, {0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}}  
    {{-0.5f, 0.5f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}}  
};
```

Now we can create the index buffer

```c++
const std::vector<uint16_t> indices = {  
    0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0  
};
```

We can either use `uint16_t` or `uint32_t` depending on the amount of indices we are going to be using. If we were to use more than 6600 we should opt for the `uint32_t`. Same as for the vertex buffer indices will be stored in class member variable in `VkBuffer` type

```c++
VkBuffer m_indexBuffer;  
VkDeviceMemory m_indexBufferMemory;
```

The creation of the index buffer is identical to the creation of the vertex buffer. We will first put data to the staging buffer and copy them to the fastest possible memory type. This memory type is flagged with `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT`
The usage of the index buffer should be marked with `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDEX_BUFFER_BIT`

```c++
void HelloTriangle::CreateIndexBuffers() {  
    BufferCreateInfo bufferCreateInfo{};  
    bufferCreateInfo.physicalDevice = m_physicalDevice;  
    bufferCreateInfo.logicalDevice = m_device;  
    bufferCreateInfo.surface = m_sruface;  
  
    bufferCreateInfo.properties = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT;  
    bufferCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT;  
    bufferCreateInfo.size = sizeof(uint16_t) * indices.size();  
  
    VkBuffer stagingBuffer;  
    VkDeviceMemory stagingMemory;  
    CreateBuffer(bufferCreateInfo, stagingBuffer, stagingMemory);  
  
    //put data to the staging buffer  
    void* data;  
    vkMapMemory(m_device, stagingMemory, 0, bufferCreateInfo.size,0, &data);  
    memcpy(data, indices.data(), (size_t)bufferCreateInfo.size);  
    vkUnmapMemory(m_device, stagingMemory);  
  
    //create index buffer  
    bufferCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDEX_BUFFER_BIT;  
    bufferCreateInfo.properties = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT;  
    CreateBuffer(bufferCreateInfo, m_indexBuffer, m_indexBufferMemory);  
  
    //copy staging buffer to the index buffer  
    CopyBuffer(m_device ,m_transferQueue, m_transferCommandPool, stagingBuffer, m_indexBuffer, bufferCreateInfo.size);  
  
    //clean up  
    vkDestroyBuffer(m_device, stagingBuffer, nullptr);  
    vkFreeMemory(m_device, stagingMemory, nullptr);  
}
```

## Using Index buffer

While recording the command buffer we have to bind the the index buffer. **After** we have bound vertex buffer

```c++
vkCmdBindIndexBuffer(commandBuffer, m_indexBuffer, 0, VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16);
```

Note how we used `VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16` since our indices are `uint16_t`. 

Binding the index buffer has no impact yet we have to change the draw command in order to use the index buffer.

```c++
vkCmdDrawIndexed(commandBuffer,static_cast<uint32_t>(indices.size()),1,0,0,0);
/*
PARAMS
	- what command buffer to use
	- number of indices
	- number of instances
	- first index start
	- vertexOffset
	- first instance 
*/
```

## Important note vol.2

As mentioned previously we should create multiple buffers from the same memory allocation instead of allocating memory for separate buffers. We should also put index and vertex buffer to the single `VkBuffer` and use offset as this is more cache friendly and better epitomised.
