For now our vertex buffer works but it is not the most efficient way for GPU to read the data. The most efficient memory type is `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT` which is usually not accessible on the CPU. 

We will create 2 vertex buffers one into which we will store the data (*staging buffer*) and another one which we will copy the data into so that it is as efficient for GPU as possible.

We have abstracted away the functionality of the called
