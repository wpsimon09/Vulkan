Buffers in Vulkan are used to store any data that GPU can access. Unlike objects that we have created so far buffers do not allocate their memory automatically so we need to do that instead. 

Information about the buffer is specified by the `VkBufferCreateInfo` structure and we will fill it like this

```c++
VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo{};  
bufferInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO;  
bufferInfo.size = sizeof(vertices[0]) *vertices.size();  
// might be more using | operator  
bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT;  
// specifies if it can be shared between queue families  
// we will use it only for the graphics family  
bufferInfo.sharingMode = VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE;  
//sparse buffer memmory  
bufferInfo.flags = 0;
```

Now we can create the buffer and store its handle inside the class member called `m_vertexBuffer`

```c++
if(vkCreateBuffer(m_device, &bufferInfo, nullptr, &m_vertexBuffer) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create Vertex Buffer");  
}
```

Similarly to every creation we must not forget to delete the buffer in the clean up method 

```c++
vkDestroyBuffer(m_device, m_vertexBuffer, nullptr);
```
