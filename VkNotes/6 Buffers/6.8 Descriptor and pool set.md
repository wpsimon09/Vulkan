As mentioned descriptor layouts just describe the buffers that are going to be used. To actual use them we will create descriptor set that will have access to the UBO and can bind them to be used in the shader.

They can not be created by them selves. We first have to create descriptor pool with all available information.  

We first have to specify which descriptor types and how many of them the descriptor set will contain. We do this by filling in the `VkDescriptorPoolSize` structe

```c++
VkDescriptorPoolSize poolSize{.type = VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER};  
poolSize.descriptorCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);
```

It only has two fields `type` and `count` the type specifies for what buffer type we are creating the descriptor pool. This structure is later referenced by `VkPoolCreateInfo` struct

```c++
VkDescriptorPoolCreateInfo poolInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_POOL_CREATE_INFO};  
poolInfo.poolSizeCount =1;  
poolInfo.pPoolSizes = &poolSize;  
//maximum number of descriptors created from this pool
poolInfo.maxSets = static_cast<uint32_t>(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);
```

Now we can store the descriptor set as a class member variable and create it using `VkCreateDesciptorPool

```c++
if(vkCreateDescriptorPool(m_device, &poolInfo, nullptr, &m_descriptorPool) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create descriptor pool");
```
