We will start by removing hard coded vertex positions (and colours) from the `VertexShader` . Instead we will replace with `layout (location = n) in vec2 xxx` which specifies the input to the Vertex shader that will come from the GPU buffer

The new Vertex shader will look like this.

```glsl
layout (location = 0) in vec2 inPosition;  
layout (location = 1) in vec3 inColor;  
  
layout (location = 0) out vec3 color;  
  
void main() {  
    gl_Position = vec4(positions[gl_VertexIndex],0.0,1.0);  
    color =  colors[gl_VertexIndex];  
}
```

> NOTE: as can be seen we used `layout = 0` and imidietly `layout = 1` which is okay for `vec3` data type. If we were to use `dvec3` (64 bit floating point variable) it would have taken up 2 slots so it would need to by specified as `layout = 2` same goes for matrices

## Creating vertex arrays

We will use `glm` to specify types such as `vec3` or `vec2` we will encapsulate data needed for the Vertex creation to the `Vertex` struct. And store the actual data as a simple array.


```c++  
struct Vertex {  
    glm::vec2 pos;  
    glm::vec3 color;  
};

const std::vector<Vertex> vertices = {  
    {{0.0f, -0.5f}, {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}},  
    {{0.5f, 0.5f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}},  
    {{-0.5f, 0.5f}, {0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}}  
};
```

The way we have specified the vertex attributes (colour and position) is called *interleaving vertex attributes*

## Binding description

Now we have to specify how we are going to pass such data to the vertex shader from the GPU memory (which we still need to fill in). This is specified by the  `VkVertexInputsBindingDescription` struct and `VkVertexInputAttributeDescription` structure.

We will focus on the first one now. We will create the method in the Vertex struct to populate this structure with the right data. 

```c++
 VkVertexInputBindingDescription bindingDescription{};  
//we only get information from one array  
bindingDescription.binding = 0;  
//nubmer of bites between each data entry  
bindingDescription.stride = sizeof(Vertex);  
//move to the next vertex after each vertex not aftera each instance  
bindingDescription.inputRate = VK_VERTEX_INPUT_RATE_VERTEX;
``` 

If we would not have the struct and have values for colours and positions stored in separate arrays we could do it like so 

```c++
VkVertexInputBindingDescription bindingDescriptions[2]; bindingDescriptions[0].binding = 0; 
bindingDescriptions[0].stride = sizeof(glm::vec2); 
bindingDescriptions[0].inputRate = VK_VERTEX_INPUT_RATE_VERTEX; 

bindingDescriptions[1].binding = 1; 
bindingDescriptions[1].stride =sizeof(glm::vec3); 
bindingDescriptions[1].inputRate = VK_VERTEX_INPUT_RATE_VERTEX;
```

## Attribute description

We have not specified which data belong to which vertex. However we don't know yet which binding is position or what is the offset to get the colour from the position and such.

With attribute description we can more closely relate `layout (location = 0) in xxx` and specify what should be here 

>NOTE we have to crate attribute description **for each** vertex attribute so we will have one for position, one for texture mapping etc.

```c++
static std::array<VkVertexInputAttributeDescription,2> getAttributeDescriptions() {  
    std::array<VkVertexInputAttributeDescription,2> attributeDescriptions;  

	//which vertex array binding to use 
	attributeDescriptions[0].binding = 0;  
	//location in shader 
	attributeDescriptions[0].location = 0;  

	//vec2 has 2 32-bit float components (in glsl layout(location = 1) in vec3   colour)  
	attributeDescriptions[0].format = VK_FORMAT_R32G32_SFLOAT;  
	
	//offset to the position 
	attributeDescriptions[0].offset = offsetof(Vertex, pos);

    return attributeDescriptions;  
}
```

The `format` field is specified using colour because this is how it is in Vulkan :). Other possible types can be:
- **float** - `VK_FORMAT_R32_SFLOAT`
- **vec2** - `VK_FORMAT_R32G32_SFLOAT`
- **vec3** - `VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SFLOAT`
- **vec4** - `VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT`
- **ivec2** - `VK_FORMAT_R32G32_SINT`, a 2-component vector of 32-bit signed integers
- **uvec4** - `VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_UINT`, a 4-component vector of 32-bit unsigned integers
- **double** - `VK_FORMAT_R64_SFLOAT`, a double-precision (64-bit) float

Now we can specify the vertex attribute for the colour as well
```c++
//which vertex array binding to use  
attributeDescriptions[1].binding = 0;  
//location in shader  
attributeDescriptions[1].location = 1;  
//vec3 has 3 32-bit float components (in glsl layout(location = 1) in vec3 colour)  
attributeDescriptions[1].format = VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SFLOAT;  
//offset to the position  
attributeDescriptions[1].offset = offsetof(Vertex, color);
```
