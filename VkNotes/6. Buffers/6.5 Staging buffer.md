For now our vertex buffer works but it is not the most efficient way for GPU to read the data. The most efficient memory type is `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT` which is usually not accessible on the CPU. 

We will create 2 vertex buffers one into which we will store the data (*staging buffer*) and another one which we will copy the data into so that it is as efficient for GPU as possible.

We have abstracted away the functionality of creating the buffer so that we can reuse it without any complications just by calling the following.

```c++
BufferCreateInfo bufferInfo{};  
bufferInfo.size = sizeof(vertices[0]) * vertices.size();  
bufferInfo.properties = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT |  
                        VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT;  
bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT;  
bufferInfo.surface = m_sruface;  
bufferInfo.logicalDevice = m_device;  
bufferInfo.physicalDevice = m_physicalDevice;  
  
CreateBuffer(bufferInfo, m_vertexBuffer, m_vertexBufferMemory);
```

This will create allocate and bind the buffer to the allocated memory. Additionally it will store the handle through which we can access the buffer. 

Now we can create the staging buffer

```c++
VkBuffer stagingBuffer;  
VkDeviceMemory stagingBufferMemory;
//source of the memory transform operation
//we will transfor to the GPU local memroy from this buffer
bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT;  
CreateBuffer(bufferInfo, stagingBuffer, stagingBufferMemory);  
  
void* data;  
vkMapMemory(m_device, stagingBufferMemory, 0, bufferInfo.size, 0, &data);  
memcpy(data, vertices.data(), (size_t)bufferInfo.size);  
vkUnmapMemory(m_device, stagingBufferMemory);
```

We also mus not forget about the actual vertex buffer that we aim to use later. 

```c++
bufferInfo.usage =
// we will use this buffer as memory transfer destination and as vertex buffer at once
VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;
//and we want it to be the fastes memory possible
bufferInfo.properties = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT;  
CreateBuffer(bufferInfo, m_vertexBuffer, m_vertexBufferMemory);
```

Since we have specified to use `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT` we are not able to map the vertex buffer to the memory. However we are able to copy to this buffer from the staging buffer. 

All of the memory transfer happens withing command buffer therefore we have created the command pool specifically for the memory transfer as it might be better optimised by the driver 

```c++
//this command pool should be optimised for mem. transfer operations
poolInfo.flags = VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT;  
poolInfo.queueFamilyIndex = queueFamilyIndices.transferFamily.value();  
if(vkCreateCommandPool(m_device,&poolInfo, nullptr, &m_transferCommandPool) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create transfer command pool");  
}
```

Now that we have the command pool from which we can create the command buffer

```c++
VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo allocInfo{};  
allocInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_ALLOCATE_INFO;  
allocInfo.level = VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_LEVEL_PRIMARY;  
allocInfo.commandPool = transferCommandPool;  
allocInfo.commandBufferCount = 1;  
  
VkCommandBuffer commandBuffer;  
vkAllocateCommandBuffers(logicalDevice, &allocInfo, &commandBuffer);
```

Once created we can now imidietly begin record it.

```c++
VkCommandBufferBeginInfo beginInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_BEGIN_INFO};  
// we will use the command buffer only once and use it again once it is submitted 
beginInfo.flags = VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT;  
vkBeginCommandBuffer(commandBuffer, &beginInfo);
```

Now we can execute the copy information by specifying the `VkRegioon` struct that specifies offset of the source, offset of the destination and size (it is not possible to pass `VK_WHOLE_SIZE`) here.

```c++
VkBufferCopy copyRegion{};  
copyRegion.srcOffset = 0;  
copyRegion.dstOffset = 0;  
copyRegion.size = size;  
vkCmdCopyBuffer(commandBuffer, srcBuffer, dstBuffer,1,&copyRegion);
vkEndCommandBuffer(commandBuffer);
```

Since we only move the data we can imidietly stop recording the command buffer and submit it to the queue.

```c++
VkSubmitInfo submitInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SUBMIT_INFO};  
submitInfo.commandBufferCount = 1;  
submitInfo.pCommandBuffers = &commandBuffer;  

//there is nothing happening after this so we dont have to turn any semaphore or fence
vkQueueSubmit(transferQueue, 1, &submitInfo, VK_NULL_HANDLE);  
//wait on transfer to complete
vkQueueWaitIdle(transferQueue);
```

> NOTE: we are waiting for the transfer queue to finish instead of the fence. But we could wait for the fence so that we can submit multiple transfer operations and wait for them to finish

Now that we know that operation has completed (thanks to the `vkQueueWaitIdle`) we can free up the command buffer

```c++
vkFreeCommandBuffers(logicalDevice, transferCommandPool, 1, &commandBuffer);
```

Copying functionality is now finish and we can now actually call the copy function 

```c++
CopyBuffer(m_device, m_transferQueue, m_transferCommandPool,stagingBuffer, m_vertexBuffer,bufferInfo.size);
```

And we must not forget to clean up all used resources like staging buffer since it is no longer relevant.

```c++
vkDestroyBuffer(m_device, stagingBuffer, nullptr);  
vkFreeMemory(m_device, stagingBufferMemory, nullptr);
```

## Important note

In the real world applications we should not call the `vkAlloateMemory` for each and every buffer. Instead we should use the offset parameter so that we allocate bigger chunk of memory and split it to the different buffers.
