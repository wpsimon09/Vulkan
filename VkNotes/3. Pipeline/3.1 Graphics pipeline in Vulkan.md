From `OpenGL` we could change the pipeline settings at will during the runtime of the program. Like we could change the blend function using `glBlendFunc` anytime, same applied for stencil/depth testing.

Here it is not the case and the graphics pipeline is almost fully immutable. Meaning it can not be changed at will. 

This means that every time we want to change something we have to recreate the graphics pipeline from scratch. This includes operations such as changing shades, binding different frame buffer or change blending function. 

Most suitable appraoch is to create graphics pipeline for every combination of the operations we want to use.
