Now we can combine everything together to create graphics pipeline. To recap we have created the following

- shader stages
- fixed functionality state 
- pipeline layout: uniform and other variables that can be changed during render time and are referenced by the shader 
- render pass: attachments referenced by the pipeline 
With all this information we can fill in the struct `VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo`

```c++
VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo pipelineInfo{};  
pipelineInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_GRAPHICS_PIPELINE_CREATE_INFO;  
pipelineInfo.stageCount = 2;  
pipelineInfo.pStages = shaderStages;
```

we will start by specifying the shaders that are going to be used by the graphics pipeline. Shaders have to be instances of  `VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo` struct 

And now we will fill in the next 

```c++
VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo pipelineInfo{};  
pipelineInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_GRAPHICS_PIPELINE_CREATE_INFO;  
pipelineInfo.stageCount = 2;  
//shaders  
pipelineInfo.pStages = shaderStages;  
//fixed functionality  
pipelineInfo.pVertexInputState = &vertexInputInfo;  
pipelineInfo.pInputAssemblyState = &inputAssemblyCreateInfo;  
pipelineInfo.pViewportState = &viewPortState;  
pipelineInfo.pRasterizationState= &rasterizerCreateInfo;  
pipelineInfo.pMultisampleState = &multisampleCreateInfo;  
pipelineInfo.pDepthStencilState = nullptr;  
pipelineInfo.pColorBlendState = &colourBlendCreateInfo;  
pipelineInfo.pDynamicState = &dynamicStateCreateInfo;  
//pipeline layout for uniforms  
pipelineInfo.layout = m_pipelineLayout;  
//render pass  
pipelineInfo.renderPass = m_renderPass;  
pipelineInfo.subpass = 0;  
//pipeline handle  
pipelineInfo.basePipelineHandle = VK_NULL_HANDLE;  
pipelineInfo.basePipelineIndex  = 0;
```

We can also create pipeline from the already existing ones by specifying the `basePipelineHandl` and `basePipelineIndex`. This is quicker and less expensive to preform. To do this we have to specify the `pipelineInfo.flags = VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT` . 

Now we can store the pipeline in the member of the class to be later referenced.

```c++
if(vkCreateGraphicsPipelines(m_device, VK_NULL_HANDLE,1,&pipelineInfo, nullptr, &m_graphicsPipeline)) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create graphics pipeline");  
}
```
This function has more parameters than usual create function. This is because the `vkCreateGraphicsPipeline` function is designed to create multiple pipelines in one go. so it can accept multiple `VkGraphicsPiplineCreateInfo` structs.

The `VK_HANDLE_PARAMETER` specifies the *pipeline cache* which is used when pipeline is recreated so that data can be preserved. Additionally we can use file to load this data to speed up pipeline creation process.

Now the pipeline has to be deleted **before the pipeline layout**. 

```c++
vkDestroyPipeline(m_device, m_graphicsPipeline, nullptr);  
vkDestroyPipelineLayout(m_device, m_pipelineLayout, nullptr);  
vkDestroyRenderPass(m_device, m_renderPass, nullptr);
```
