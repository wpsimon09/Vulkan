Vulkan is OS agnostic meaning it can not directly interact with any window. Therefore we have to use extension to allow Vulkan to present stuff on the screen (in created window). This extension is called `VK_KHR_sruface` and we have already enabled it by querying the `glfwGetRequeiredExtentionsList`. The `VK_KHR_sruface` is and **instance level extension** as can be seen here 
```c++
VkInstanceCreateInfo createInfo{};  
createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO;

auto extentions = GetRequiredExtentions();  
createInfo.enabledExtensionCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(extentions.size());  
createInfo.ppEnabledExtensionNames = extentions.data();
```

> NOTE: window surface needs to be created **right after** the instance creation as it might influence the selection of physical device

The surface creation is handled via glfw and thanks to that the surface creation code is platform agnostic.

```c++
void HelloTriangle::CreateSurface() {  
    if(glfwCreateWindowSurface(m_instance, m_window, nullptr,&m_sruface) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create window surface");  
    }  
}
```

We must not forget to delete the surface **before we delete the instance** 

```c++
vkDestroySurfaceKHR(m_instance, m_sruface, nullptr);
//delete instance 
```

Now we have to check if the device that we have selected supports the presentation in the given window. This actually is queue specific feature and we have to check the queue family if it supports presentation feature instead of checking if device supports it.

In another words the queue family is actually device specific so we are checking the device for it anyway but we use queue family to do so.

```c++
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR(device, i, surface, &presentSupport);  
if(presentSupport) {  
    indices.presentFamily = i;  
}
```
>NOTE: Since the present surface is an extension we can not use `queueFlags & VK_PRESENT_SURFACE` in addition it will likely result in the same queue family

Now we have to retrieve the **presentation queue handle**. This is done while creating the logical device.  But we first need to create variable that will hold this queue. The variable is 

```c++
VkQueue m_presentationQueue;
```
As can be seen it has the same type as graphics queue

Since we have 2 different queue families we have to create 2 different `VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo` structs. We can use for loop to go through every queue family we want

```c++
QueueFamilyIndices indices = FindQueueFamilies(m_physicalDevice, m_sruface);  
std::vector<VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo> queueCreateInfos;  
std::set<uint32_t> uniqueQueueFamilies = {indices.graphicsFamily.value, indices.presentFamily.value()};  
  
float queuePriority = 1.0f;  
for (auto queueFamily: uniqueQueueFamilies) {  
    VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo queueCreateInfo{};  
    queueCreateInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_QUEUE_CREATE_INFO;  
    queueCreateInfo.queueFamilyIndex = queueFamily;  
    queueCreateInfo.queueCount = 1;  
    queueCreateInfo.pQueuePriorities = &queuePriority;  
    queueCreateInfos.push_back(queueCreateInfo);  
}
```

We can pass the vector and its size (number of components) to the `VkDeviceCreateInfo` to not loop through the vector when not necessary.

This is done during the logical device creation process

```c++
createInfo.pQueueCreateInfos = queueCreateInfos.data();  
createInfo.queueCreateInfoCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(queueCreateInfos.size());  
```
Lastly, we must not retrieve the queue handle through which we can manipulate the logical device.
