Vulkan has no concept of "default frame buffer". We have to explicitly gather images in which we will render, submit them to the queue from which they are presented on the screen. The created infrastructure is referred to as **swap chain**. The main purpose of swap chain is to present images with respect to the screen *refresh rate*

Since not all hardware supports swap chain (servers don't as they don't have any display) we have to check if the swap chain is supported. Additionally, swap chain heavily depends on the window surface and since Vulkan is platform agnostic we have to enable `VK_KHR_swapchain` extension.

We can check if the extension is supported by querying extensions in the **physical device**.

Once we know that physical device supports swap chain, we can enable it during **logical device** creation process

```c++
createInfo.enabledExtensionCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(deviceExtentions.size());  

createInfo.ppEnabledExtensionNames = deviceExtentions.data();
```

To continue we have to set up more stuff but before we do that we have to check for few details. Namely:
- Surface capability
	- min/max number of images in swap chain
	- min/max width and height of images
- Surface format 
	- pixel format
	- colour space 
- Available presentation modes 
In order to retrieve surface capability we have to call `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR(physicalDevice, surface, &details.capabilities);` this function stores the surface capabilities inside `VkSurfaceCababilitiesKHR` variable 

To get the surface format we can use the following code 
```c++
uint32_t formatCount;  
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR(physicalDevice, surface, &formatCount, nullptr);  
if(formatCount != 0) {  
    details.formats.resize(formatCount);  
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR(physicalDevice, surface, &formatCount, details.formats.data());  
}
```

The same will apply for the presentation modes 
```c++
uint32_t presentModeCount;  
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR(physicalDevice, surface, &presentModeCount, nullptr);  
if(presentModeCount != 0) {  
	details.presentModes.resize(presentModeCount);  
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR(physicalDevice, surface, &presentModeCount, details.presentModes.data());  
}
```

Now that we have retrieved all required data we can check if the physical device that we are using supports required features. That is the window surface we have must contain at least one image format and one presentation mode. 

> This is how the queried information stored in the struct looks like 
> ![[Images/swapchain-info.png]]

To create the most suitable swap chain we have to take a look at the following factors
- Surface format 
	- colour depth, HDR, linear etc.
- Presentation mode 
	- conditions for swaping images(FIFO, relaxed etc.)
- Swap extend
	- resolutions of the images in swap chain

We need to select suitable value for each or automatically the second best thing 

## Right format
the `VkSurfaceFormatKHR` consists of 2 values **format** and **colour space** the format is same like in OpenGL `GL_RGB` for Vulkan this format is `VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB` 

Colour space is for weather it is linear (no gamma correction) or non-linear (gamma corrected) 

From the above we want to have `VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB`for the format and for the colour space we want to have `VK_COLOR_SPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR` 

```c++
for(const auto& availableFormat: availableFormats) {  
    if(availableFormat.format == VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB && availableFormat.colorSpace == VK_COLOR_SPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR) {  
        return availableFormat;  
    }  
}
```

## Right presentation mode 
It represents the actual condition at which to show the images on screen. There are several options to choose from 

`VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMIDIATE_KHR`
	images transformed by application are displayed right away (might result in tearing)
`VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR` 
	Images are in queue, the display takes the first one and programs insets at the end of the queue. If queue is full the program has to wait. **Good for mobile devices** as it saves energy 
`VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR`
	 Same as previous one but when queue is empty the application sends the image right away to the display. This results in visible tearing. 
`VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR`
	Uses FIFO but when the queue is full the images at the end are replaced instead of waiting while there is available space. This is fast and is known as **triple buffering**. **Good for computers** as it eats up quite some energy

Since we have queried for this information we can now loop through the list of available present mode and choose Mailbox. If that is not found that we will use FIFO
```c++
inline VkPresentModeKHR chooseSwapPresentMode(const std::vector<VkPresentModeKHR> &availablePresentModes) {  
    for (const auto& availblePresentMode: availablePresentModes) {  
        if(availblePresentMode == VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR) {  
            return availblePresentMode;  
        }  
    }  
    return VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR;  
}
```

## Swap extent
The swap extent is a size and possible resolution of the swap chain images stored inside `VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR`. The resolution of swap chain images is almost always the same as the window we are drawing into.  We should use `VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.currentExtend` to set the resolution of the window. We can use max amount of `uint32_t` and select `VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.maxExtend` and `VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.minExtend` to best match the resolution of the window. This however needs to be in pixels and not in screen coordinates and we have to use `glfwGetFrameBufferSize` to retrieve the correct values to pass to the `maxExtend` and `minExtend`. 

>NOTE: We can not use the width and height constants specified at the beginning during the window creation process

```c++
if (capabilities.currentExtent.width != std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()) {  
    //we are going with the window size to be set as current extend  
    return capabilities.currentExtent;  
}  
//teh current extend is max of uint32_t and we adjust max width and height for the swap chain images instead  
int width, height;  
glfwGetFramebufferSize(window, &width, &height);  
  
VkExtent2D acctualExtend = {  
    static_cast<uint32_t>(width),  
    static_cast<uint32_t>(height)  
};  
  
acctualExtend.width = std::clamp(acctualExtend.width, capabilities.minImageExtent.width,  
                                 capabilities.maxImageExtent.width);  
acctualExtend.height = std::clamp(acctualExtend.height, capabilities.minImageExtent.height,  
                                  capabilities.maxImageExtent.height);  
  
return acctualExtend;
```

## Creating swap chain
Now that we have all functions that choose right properties for the swap chain we can actually create it.

The creation of the swap chain should be done **after logical device creation**

```c++
SwapChainSupportDetails swapChainSupport = querySwapChainSupport(m_physicalDevice,m_sruface);  

//surface format (colour and image space )
VkSurfaceFormatKHR surfaceFormat = chooseSwapSurfaceFormat(swapChainSupport.formats);  

//present mode (fifo, mailbox..., when should swap chain swap images ?)
VkPresentModeKHR presentMode = chooseSwapPresentMode(swapChainSupport.presentModes);  

//extent (image size)
VkExtent2D extent = chooseSwapExtent(swapChainSupport.capabilities, m_window);  
  
//images in swap chain (array of images)  
uint32_t imageCount = swapChainSupport.capabilities.minImageCount + 1;  
  
//make sure to not go over the limit of images in swap chain  
if(swapChainSupport.capabilities.maxImageCount > 0 && imageCount > swapChainSupport.capabilities.maxImageCount) {  
    imageCount = swapChainSupport.capabilities.maxImageCount;  
}
```

Now we have all information that swap chain needs, that is. Surface format  (SRGB8BIT), colour space (linear, non-linear), present mode (when should swap chain swap images) and extent (width and height of the images ).

Now we can fill in `VkSwapChainCreateInfoKHR` struct to instantiate the swap chain.

```c++
VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR createInfo {};  
createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_INFO_KHR;  
createInfo.surface = m_sruface;  
  
createInfo.minImageCount = imageCount;  
createInfo.imageFormat = surfaceFormat.format;  
createInfo.imageColorSpace = surfaceFormat.colorSpace;  
createInfo.imageExtent = extent;  
//layer for setreoscopic 3D application  
createInfo.imageArrayLayers = 1;  
//how images will be used 
createInfo.imageUsage = VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT;
```
>NOTE this is just basic image information

Since we have used 2 queue families `present` and `grpahics` we need to specify how to handle swap chain images that are used across the queue families .
In our case we will be drawing to swap chain images using `graphics` queue and we will present them using `presentation` queue

There are 2 ways we can go around this 
`VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE`
	 similar to the unique_ptr swap chain image is owned only by one queue family at the time. We have to explicitly transfer the owner ship between different queue families. 
	*Best for prefomance*
`VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURENT`
	similar to shared_ptr, images can be used across multiple queue families and no explicit ownership transfer is required
We are going to use concurrent mode for simplicity. This require us to specify which  queue families will have access to the swap chain image. 

>If graphics and presentation queue family are the same we should use `VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE` because `VK_CONCURENT_MODE` requires to specify at least 2 **different** queue families
>

```c++
  
QueueFamilyIndices indices =  FindQueueFamilies(m_physicalDevice,m_sruface);  
uint32_t queueFamilyIndecies[]={indices.graphicsFamily.value(), indices.presentFamily.value()};  
  
//if presentation and graphics queue family are the same use the exlusive mode  
//otherwise use concurent mode 
if(indices.graphicsFamily != indices.presentFamily) {  
    createInfo.imageSharingMode = VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT;  
    createInfo.queueFamilyIndexCount = 2;  
    createInfo.pQueueFamilyIndices = queueFamilyIndecies;  
}else {  
    createInfo.imageSharingMode = VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE;  
}
```

now we can fill in the rest of the structure
```c++
//horizontal flip, 90 deg rotation  
createInfo.preTransform = swapChainSupport.capabilities.currentTransform;  
//blend with other windows ? no  
createInfo.compositeAlpha = VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR;  
//mailbox, fifo etc...  
createInfo.presentMode = presentMode;  
//if other window is infrotn of current window dont calculate pixels
createInfo.clipped = VK_TRUE;  
//it can happend that swap chain will have to be recreted again, we wont do it here hence NULL  
createInfo.oldSwapchain = VK_NULL_HANDLE;
```

>NOTE: Entirety of the structure could be hard coded, however our approach, meaning that we retrieve various parameters about swap chain, is more robust and error prone 


Now we can finally create the swap chain instance 
```c++
if(vkCreateSwapchainKHR(m_device, &createInfo, nullptr, &m_swapChain) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create swap chain");  
}
```

We should also delete it **before the logical device**

## Image retrieval 
Now that swap chain is created we can retrieve and store the image handlers in which we can preform drawing operations

The image handlers are stored in `std::vector<VkImage>`. The images are created by the implementation and automatically deleted when Swap Chain was destroyed. 

We retrieve swap chain images regularly.

```c++
  
vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR(m_device, m_swapChain, &imageCount, nullptr);  
m_swapChainImages.resize(imageCount);  
vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR(m_device, m_swapChain, &imageCount, m_swapChainImages.data());
```
>NOTE: we specified only minimum amount of swap chain images and implementation can create more therefore it is important to query the number of created images as well.
