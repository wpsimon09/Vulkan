We will use the following class to execute our application

```cpp
class HelloTriangle {  
	public:  
		//runs all private function in the order of declaration
	    void run();  
	private:  
	    void initVulkan();  
	    void mainLoop();  
	    void cleanUp();  
  
};
```

Vulkan objects can be created 2 ways `vkCreatexxx` or allocated using `vkAllocatexxx` later is being done through the function

Than they need to be deleted using `vkDestoryxxx` or `vkFreeexxx` accordingly. The parameters are different based on object but `pAllocator` parameter is the same. It is used as callback for custom allocation and deallocation of the memory. 

## Creating Vulkan Instance
*Vulkan instance* is the connection between Vulkan library and application. It will specify some additional information to the drivers.

Vulkan instance has the following type `VkInstance`.

To create it we will create and struct that will specify additional information using `VkApplicationInfo` this is an **optional step**

the struct looks as follows:

```cpp
void HelloTriangle::CreateInstance() {  
    VkApplicationInfo appInfo {};  
    appInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_APPLICATION_INFO;  
    appInfo.pApplicationName = "Hello triangle";  
    appInfo.applicationVersion = VK_MAKE_VERSION(1,0,0);  
    appInfo.pEngineName = "No Engine";  
    appInfo.engineVersion = VK_MAKE_VERSION(1,0,0);  
    appInfo.apiVersion = VK_API_VERSION_1_3;  
      
    //extention callback  
    appInfo.pNext = nullptr;  
}
```

We need to fill additional struct as well which is **not optional** this struct tells driver which **global** extensions and *validation layers* we will use . This struct is called `VkInstaceCreateInfo`

```cpp
VkInstanceCreateInfo createInfo{};  
createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO;  
//reference to application info  
createInfo.pApplicationInfo = &appInfo;
```

Next we have to specify the platform specific extensions using glfw

```cpp
  
uint32_t glfwExtentionCount;  
const char ** glfwExtentions;  
glfwExtentions = glfwGetRequiredInstanceExtensions(&glfwExtentionCount);  
  
createInfo.enabledExtensionCount = glfwExtentionCount;  
createInfo.ppEnabledExtensionNames = glfwExtentions;
//number of validation layers  
createInfo.enabledLayerCount = 0;
```

Now we have all information to create the Vulkan instance we can do it using the flowing

```cpp
  
if(vkCreateInstance(&createInfo, nullptr, &m_instance) !=VK_SUCCESS) 
{  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create intance ");  
}
```

We can retrieve list of supported extentions using `vkEnumerateINstanceExtensionsProperties` using the following 

```cpp
  
uint32_t extenstionsCount;  
//get cound ot extentions  
vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(
	nullptr, //layer
	&extenstionsCount, //query number of extentions 
	nullptr);  
	
std::vector<VkExtensionProperties> extentions(extenstionsCount);  

vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(
	nullptr, //layer
	&extenstionsCount, //query the number 
	extentions.data()); //where to store them
```

the `VkExtensionProperties` have name and version if we loop through the struct we will see the following output

```outpu
available extensions:
	VK_KHR_device_group_creation	V: 1
	VK_KHR_display	V: 23
	VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities	V: 1
	VK_KHR_external_memory_capabilities	V: 1
	VK_KHR_external_semaphore_capabilities	V: 1
	...and more
```

we should delete the instance inside the clean method 

```c++
vkDestroyInstance(m_instance, nullptr);
```

Every other resource should be **destroyed before** the Vulcan instance
