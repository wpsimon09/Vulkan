**Logical device** is an interface we can use to utilise the physical device. We can have as many logical devices as we want. Each would operate independently. 

We have to describe the features that it will use as well as queues we it to have. The logical device is stored in `VkDevice`

First thing is to specify Queue(s) we want to use using `VkDeviceQueueInfo` struct. This specify the number of Queues we want to use for the certain queue family this struct looks like this 

```c++
//finds queue family with graphics capabilities VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT  
//queue families are pulled from the physical device
QueueFamilyIndices indices = FindQueueFamilies(m_physicalDevice);  
VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo queueCreateInfo{};  
queueCreateInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_QUEUE_CREATE_INFO;  
queueCreateInfo.queueFamilyIndex = indices.graphicsFamily.value();  
queueCreateInfo.queueCount = 1;
```

We do not really need more than 1 queue as we can submit commands to **command buffers** on multiple threads and populate the in the queue in the **main** thread.

We can specify the priority to the queue to change the order of execution. This is mandatory. The priority is from 0-1 (float)

```c++
float queuePriority = 1.0f;  
queueCreateInfo.pQueuePriorities = &queuePriority;
```

Next we have to specify the features of the physical device like geometry shader, tessellation shader, anti aliasing etc. Since we are doing simple triangle we don't need more than default values.


```c++
VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures deviceFeatures{};
```

Now we can finally start filling in the main structure that will hold information about logical device. Everything we do while creating the logical device is **device specific**. Meaning that what GPU can and can not do.

The main  `VkDeviceCreateInfo` structure will look like this 
```c++
VkDeviceCreateInfo createInfo{};  
createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO;  
createInfo.pQueueCreateInfos = &queueCreateInfo;  
createInfo.queueCreateInfoCount = 1;  
createInfo.pEnabledFeatures = &deviceFeatures;  
createInfo.enabledExtensionCount = 0;  

if(enableValidationLayers) {  
    createInfo.enabledLayerCount = static_cast<uint32_t (validationLayers.size());  
    createInfo.ppEnabledLayerNames = validationLayers.data();  
}else {  
    createInfo.enabledLayerCount=  0;  
}
```

Now that we have everything set up we can instantiate the logical device using `vkCreateDevice` function.

```c++
if(vkCreateDevice(m_physicalDevice, &createInfo, nullptr, &m_device)!=VK_SUCCESS) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create logical device !");  
}
```

We should also delete it using `vkDestroyDevice` function
```c++
vkDestroyDevice(m_device, nullptr);
```

Now our logical device is created together with queues which are created along it. However we have no way of interacting with them. We will use the **queue handles** to do so. So far we have requested queue family that contains at least `VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT` in order to preform graphics operations.

To create a queue handle we have to store it using `VkQueue` type. And to retrieve it using the following function
```c++
vkGetDeviceQueue(m_device, indices.graphicsFamily.value(), 0, &m_graphicsQueue);
```
