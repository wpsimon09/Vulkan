The `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE` might not be thrown on all devices when size of the window changes ,thus it is good idea to keep track of this ourselfs.

We will crate new variable that will hold information if the window was changes

To retrieve the `this` of the class we are using we can pass the pointer using `glfwSetUserPointer` which can be accessed in the callback function (since it is static) 

```c++
glfwSetWindowUserPointer(m_window, this);
```

Now we can use the `this` variable inside the callback function like this 

```c++
void HelloTriangle::FrameBufferResizeCallback(GLFWwindow *window, int width, int height) {  
    std::cout<<"Resize x: "<<width<<"y: "<<height<<std::endl;  
    auto app = reinterpret_cast<HelloTriangle*>(glfwGetWindowUserPointer((window)));  
    app->m_frameBufferResized = true;  
}
```
