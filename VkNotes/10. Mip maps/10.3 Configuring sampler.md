`VkImage` contains all of the texture data, however `VkSampler` is in charge of deciding which mip levels to use. 

In Vulkan we can specify the following options to control the Level of detail (LOD) while rendering.

- *minLod* - minimum mip map to sample from usually 0
- *maxLod* - maximum mip map to sample from 
- *mipLodBias* - allows us to use lower/higher LOD than Vulkan would normally use  
- *mipMapMode* - can be `VK_SAMPLE_MIPMAP_MODE_NEAREST` , or `VK_SAMPLE_MIPMAP_MODE_LINEAR`. First one takes the mip map level and samples that, second one takes 2 mip levels to sample from and linearly interpolates between them with the aim of combining them together as one image 

To specify the values we have to go to the `CreateSampler` function and specify it there 

```c++
// mip mapping  
samplerInfo.mipmapMode = VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_LINEAR;  
samplerInfo.mipLodBias = 0.0f; // can also be physicalDeviceProperties.limits.maxSamplerLodBias  
samplerInfo.minLod = 0.0;  
samplerInfo.maxLod = m_material->GetMaximalMipValue();
```
