Our staging buffer while creating image is only used to fill in mip map at level 0. We will generate the data from the base mip level that we have available and use `vkCmdBlitImage` to scale, copy and filter the data. This command will be called multiple times, for every mip level.

Since we are going to use the base image as a both the **source** and **destination** during the `vkCmdBlitImage` (which is considered a transfer operation ) we have to tell it to Vulkan by specifying `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT`

```c++
imageCreateInfo.usage = VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT;
```

>NOTE: We are going to be working with 2 mip levels. First one is the previous mip image (src) in the mip chain and second one is the new mip level that we are filling in (dst) 

Similar to other image operations *blitting* image data depends on the image layout. Simple solution is to transfer the image  to the `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` but this might be slow. 

For the best performance the mip level that was generated before should have layout of `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL` and the one that we are generating should have layout of `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRNASFER_DST_OPTIMAL`

We will transition each level into the corresponding format between the blits.

We will start of by removing the transition to the `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`. We will transition to this stage for once we have generated mip chain.

```c++
CreateImage(imageCreateInfo, m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].image, m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].memory);  
  
TransferImageLayout(dependencyInfo, m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].image, imageCreateInfo.format, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL,m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].maxMipLevels);  
  
CopyBufferToImage(dependencyInfo,stagingImageBuffer, m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].image, static_cast<uint32_t>(texWidth),static_cast<uint32_t>(texHeight));  
  
//TransferImageLayout(dependencyInfo, m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].image, imageCreateInfo.format,VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL,m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].maxMipLevels);  
FlushCommandBuffer(dependencyInfo.commandBuffer);
```

By removing transition to the `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_OPTIMAL` we leave the image in the `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL` 

Now we can write function that will generate mip maps 

```c++
void GenerateMipMaps(ImageLayoutDependencyInfo dependency, VkImage image, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, uint32_t mipLevels) {  
    VkImageMemoryBarrier barrier{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_MEMORY_BARRIER};  
    barrier.image = image;  
    //not transitioning owenership  
    barrier.srcQueueFamilyIndex = VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED;  
    barrier.dstQueueFamilyIndex = VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED;  
  
    barrier.subresourceRange.aspectMask = VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT;  
    barrier.subresourceRange.baseArrayLayer = 0;  
    barrier.subresourceRange.layerCount = 1;  
    barrier.subresourceRange.levelCount = 1;
```

This `VkImageMemoryBarrier` will be used for each transition. Fields we have specified will remain the same, but `subresourceRange.mipLevel`, `subresourceRange.newLayout`, `subresourceRange.oldLayout`,  `srcAccessMask` and `dstAccessMask` will be changed after every transition of the layout.

Now we create loop that will blit the image for each level by recording the command buffer. 

```c++
int32_t mipWidth = width;  
int32_t mipHeight = height;  

//starts from 1 as we allready have 0 since it is the base image 
for(uint32_t i =1; i<mipLevels; i++) {  
      
}
```

First thing that we will do inside the loop is to transition level i-1 to `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SRC_OPTIMAL` since we want to transfer the layout of the already created mip from `dst` to `src`

Next we will specify the `accessMasks` and lastly execute the barrier with `vkCmdPipelineBarrier`

```c++
barrier.subresourceRange.baseMipLevel = i-1;  
barrier.oldLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL;  
barrier.newLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL;  
//access memory where data can be written into  
barrier.srcAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_WRITE_BIT;  
//access memory where data are store for reading  
barrier.dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_READ_BIT;  
vkCmdPipelineBarrier(dependency.commandBuffer, VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT,VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT, 0,  
    0,nullptr,  
    0,nullptr,  
    1,&barrier);
```
>NOTE: we only transition the i-1 to be the src destination since the dst is the default one, but we could explicitly transfer the i-th mip level to be the dst, but it would be useless

Now we can specify the blit by using `VkImageBlit` structure. 

First we will focus on specifying information about the source 

```c++
blit.srcOffsets[0] = {0,0,0}; //where to start blit.srcOffsets[1] = {mipWidth, mipHeight,1}; //where to finish  
blit.srcSubresource.aspectMask = VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT;  
blit.srcSubresource.mipLevel = i-1;  
blit.srcSubresource.baseArrayLayer = 9;  
blit.srcSubresource.layerCount = 1;
```


Now we have to specify information about the destination, that is `i-th` mip map

```c++
//tells where data that was previousle retrieved should be pased  
blit.dstOffsets[0] = {0,0,0};  
//when either dimension is not smaller than 1 devide it by 2 otherwise put 1 there blit.dstOffsets[1] = {mipWidth > 1 ? mipWidth/2: 1,mipHeight>1? mipHeight/2 :1, 1};  
blit.dstSubresource.aspectMask = VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT;  
blit.dstSubresource.mipLevel = i;  
blit.dstSubresource.baseArrayLayer = 0;  
blit.dstSubresource.layerCount = 1;
```

> NOTE: `dst` and `src` offsets have 1 as the Z coordinate since depth on the 2D image is 1, this should be changed for cube textures or cube maps

Now we can record the actual blit command and move the data to the mip level specified in `blit` strucuture

```c++
vkCmdBlitImage(dependency.commandBuffer,
			image,
			VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_SRC_OPTIMAL, 
			image ,
			VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL, 
			1, &blit,
			VK_FILTER_LINEAR);

```

Now, since we are no longer going to use mip at level i-1 we can transition it to the `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`  This is again done with `VkPipelineBarrier`
