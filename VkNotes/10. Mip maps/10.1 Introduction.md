Mip-maps are form of a LOD (Level of detail). They are smaller resulutions of the original image. Image has a chain of mip-maps where each level in the chain contains image that is half smaller than the previous one.

## Creation

Mip maps are created when creating `VkImage`. Level 0 is the original image and we have to calculate how many mip levels can image have based on its resolution. 

We will calculate the resolution and store it inside the variable of the the `Texture` struct that I have created for loading multiple textures. We will calculate maximum mip-levels using following code.

```c++

stbi_uc* pixels = stbi_load(paths[i].c_str(), &texWidth, &texHeight, &texChanels, STBI_rgb_alpha);  
  
std::cout<<"Loading texture: "<< paths[i] <<std::endl;  
  
if(!pixels) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to load textue");  
}

m_material->GetTextures()[texturesToProcess[i]].maxMipLevels = static_cast<uint32_t>(std::floor(std::log2(std::max(texWidth,texHeight)))) + 1;;
```

The `log2` will retrieve us number that will tell us how many times can be image divided by 2 and the `floor` function handles cases where image is not divisible by 2. `max` function selects the larger of two dimensions. And we add + 1.

To accommodate for mip maps we have to change `CreateImage` function, `CreateImageView` function and lastly `TransitionImageLayout` function

We will start by `CreateImage` function. First we will pass the number of mip levels to the function as a parameter inside `ImageCreateInfo` helper struct that i created

```c++
struct ImageCreateInfo {  
    //...  
    uint32_t height;  
    uint32_t mipLevels = 1;
```

Now we will use this variable while creating an image.

```c++
VkImageCreateInfo imageInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO};
imageInfo.extent.depth = 1;  
imageInfo.mipLevels = createImageInfo.mipLevels;
```

We will do the same for the remaining functions as well.
