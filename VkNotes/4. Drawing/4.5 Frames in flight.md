Right now we are waiting until the frame is drawn until we start to draw a new frame. This is not good as the host (CPU) is idling with no work. 

We will fix it with concept known as **frames in-flight** where we will render one frame without interfering with the current ones frame buffer operations. To do this we will duplicate resources that are accessed and modified by the rendering. Thus we will need multiple **command buffers, fences and semaphores**.

We will have 2 frames in flight as 3 and more might cause that CPU will be way ahead of the GPU. With 2 CPU will wait until GPU is finished before submitting new work.

We will have to change semaphore, fence and command buffer to be `std::vector` since we will duplicate this. 

We will change the function that allocated command buffer to crate more than one.

```c++
m_commandBuffers.resize(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);

VkCommandBufferAllocateInfo allocInfo{};  
allocInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_ALLOCATE_INFO;  
allocInfo.commandPool = m_comandPool;  
allocInfo.level = VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_LEVEL_PRIMARY;
//chagned from 1 to number of frame buffers 
allocInfo.commandBufferCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(m_commandBuffers.size());
```

To call it we will simply pass the pointer to the beginning of the array.

```c++
if(vkAllocateCommandBuffers(m_device,&allocInfo,m_commandBuffers.data()) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to allocate command buffer");  
}
```

For the sync objects like semaphore and fences we will alter the method like so

```c++
//resize
m_imageAvailableSemaphores.resize(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);  
m_renderFinishedSemaphores.resize(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);  
m_inFlightFences.resize(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);  

// not changed
VkSemaphoreCreateInfo semaphoreInfo{};  
semaphoreInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SEMAPHORE_CREATE_INFO;  
// not chagned 
VkFenceCreateInfo fenceInfo{};  
fenceInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FENCE_CREATE_INFO;  
fenceInfo.flags = VK_FENCE_CREATE_SIGNALED_BIT;  

//createion put in loop
for(size_t i = 0; i< MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT;i++) {  
    if(vkCreateSemaphore(m_device, &semaphoreInfo, nullptr, &m_imageAvailableSemaphores[i]) != VK_SUCCESS ||  
       vkCreateSemaphore(m_device, &semaphoreInfo, nullptr, &m_renderFinishedSemaphores[i]) != VK_SUCCESS ||  
       vkCreateFence(m_device, &fenceInfo, nullptr, &m_inFlightFences[i]) != VK_SUCCESS  
       ) {  
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create synchronization objects");  
    }  
}
```

We should use the same approach do delete them as well.

> NOTE: We also have multiple command buffers but we don't need to delete them since deletion of the *command pool* will take care of this

We will now use the current frame counter to keep track of the frame that we are currently rendering. 

This will help us to render to the frame while some other drawing operation is preformed .
To increment the index. 

```c++
currentFrame = (currentFrame + 1) % MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT;
```
