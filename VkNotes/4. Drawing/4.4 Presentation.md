Now that we have command Vulkan to draw a triangle we have to return the image into which we drew it back to the swap chain. 

This is done through `VkPresentInfoKHR` structure. 

```c++
VkPresentInfoKHR presentInfo{};  
presentInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PRESENT_INFO_KHR;  
presentInfo.waitSemaphoreCount = 1;  
presentInfo.pWaitSemaphores = signalSemaphores;
```

This is specifying on which semaphores we should wait.

Next we will tell which swap chain to use for presenting and which image index we should put to it.

```c++
VkSwapchainKHR swapChains[] = {m_swapChain};  
presentInfo.swapchainCount = 1;  
presentInfo.pSwapchains = swapChains;  
presentInfo.pImageIndices = &imageINdex;
```

>NOTE: as it goes in Vulkan most things are arrays therefore we can not just pass the swap chain itself to the `pSwapChains`

Optionally, we can retrieve the results of each swap chain which is not necessary as we only have the single one.

```c++
presentInfo.pResults = nullptr;
```

Now we can finally present the swap chain to the screen using the following function. 

```c++
vkQueuePresentKHR(m_presentationQueue,&presentInfo);
```
We can check this against `VK_SUCESS` but program should not terminate as not rendered image might not necessarily mean bad mistake. 

We should see the **triangle on the screen**. However when we close the program we see the message that says that we did not finish job on the semaphore. Since everything is happening asynchronously even tho we exit the draw functions some operations on GPU might still be happening. And we are deleting them which is not the best thing.

We can fix this by calling `vkDeviceWaitIdle`.
