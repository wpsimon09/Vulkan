Now that we have command Vulkan to draw a triangle we have to return the image into which we drew it back to the swap chain. 

This is done through `VkPresentInfoKHR` structure. 

```c++
VkPresentInfoKHR presentInfo{};  
presentInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PRESENT_INFO_KHR;  
presentInfo.waitSemaphoreCount = 1;  
presentInfo.pWaitSemaphores = signalSemaphores;
```

Now
