So far we have `VkImageView` retried from the swap chain. This needs to be wrapped using `VkFrameBuffer` object. Since we are getting images from the swap chain we have to create a frame buffer for **each** swap chain image view.  We will use the one that we retrieved from the swap chain during the render time. 

We will store the fame buffers using `std::vector<VkFramebuffer>` struct to hold frame buffer for each swap chain image. 

We will configure the frame buffer from the `VkImageView` (retrieved from swap chain as follows)

```c++
m_swapChainFrameBuffers.resize(m_swapChainImageViews.size());  
  
for(size_t i=0; i<m_swapChainImageViews.size(); i++) {  
    VkImageView attachments[] = {  
        m_swapChainImageViews[i]  
    };  
    VkFramebufferCreateInfo frameBufferInfo{};  
    frameBufferInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FRAMEBUFFER_CREATE_INFO;  
    //render pass which is supported (its attachemnt mainly)
    frameBufferInfo.renderPass = m_renderPass;  
    frameBufferInfo.attachmentCount = 1;  
    //attachemnt is the VkImageView from the swap chain and matches the render 
    //render pass attachemnt that is the colour attachment
    frameBufferInfo.pAttachments = attachments;  
    frameBufferInfo.width = m_swapChainExtent.width;  
    frameBufferInfo.height = m_swapChainExtent.height;  
    frameBufferInfo.layers = 1;  
  
    if(vkCreateFramebuffer(m_device, &frameBufferInfo, nullptr, &m_swapChainFrameBuffers[i]) != VK_SUCCESS) {  
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create frame buffers from swap chain images");  
    }  
}
```

Since we have created the frame buffers we have to delete them **before the render pass and the image views**

```c++
for (auto frameBuffer: m_swapChainFrameBuffers) {  
    vkDestroyFramebuffer(m_device, frameBuffer, nullptr);  
}
```
