Here everything will come together. We are going to create `drawFrame` function that will be called from the main loop of the application

The rendering of the frame looks briefly like this

- Acquire new image to draw into
- Record the command buffer that will draw the scene to the acquired image 
- submit the recorded command buffer 
- present the swap chain image
