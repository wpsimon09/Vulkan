We now have to change the creation of the render pass to inform Vulkan that it will contain depth image as well. 

To do that we will create new attachment description by using `VkAttachmentDescription` struct.

```c++
VkAttachmentDescription depthAttachment{};  
//format should be the same as a depht image  
depthAttachment.format = FindDepthFormat();  
depthAttachment.samples = VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT;  
depthAttachment.loadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR;  
depthAttachment.storeOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE;  
depthAttachment.stencilLoadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;  
//we dont want to read from the depth attachemnt once it was drawn into  
depthAttachment.stencilStoreOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE;  
depthAttachment.initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED;  
depthAttachment.finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
```

Now we have to create reference to this attachment so that we can pass it to the sub pass
```c++
VkAttachmentReference depthAttachmentRef{};  
depthAttachmentRef.attachment = 1;  
depthAttachmentRef.layout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
```

And lastly we can refer to this attachment in our "main" sub pass 

```c++
VkSubpassDescription subPass{};  
subPass.pipelineBindPoint = VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS;  
//reference to the colour attachemnt  
subPass.colorAttachmentCount = 1;  
subPass.pColorAttachments = &colorAttachmentRef;  
subPass.pDepthStencilAttachment = &depthAttachmentRef;
```

As can be seen the sub pass can only have one depth attachment as it would not make sense to test multiple depth buffers

Next we will pack colour and depth attachment together into the array so that we can modify the `VkCreateRenderPassInfo`

```c++
std::array<VkAttachmentDescription,2> attachemnts = {colorAttachment, depthAttachment};

VkRenderPassCreateInfo renderPassInfo{};  
renderPassInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RENDER_PASS_CREATE_INFO;  
renderPassInfo.attachmentCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(attachemnts.size());  
renderPassInfo.pAttachments = attachemnts.data();  
renderPassInfo.subpassCount = 1;  
renderPassInfo.pSubpasses = &subPass;  
renderPassInfo.dependencyCount = 1;  
renderPassInfo.pDependencies = &dependency;
```

And lastly we will modify the sub pass dependency to refer to the depth as well as the colour attachment.

```c++
VkSubpassDependency dependency{};  
dependency.srcSubpass = VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL;  
//subpass we are going to use since we only have one we will pass 0  
//dst subpass must be heigher than srcSubpass, only exception is if src is VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL  
dependency.dstSubpass = 0;  
//dependecy start  
dependency.srcStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT|VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT;  
//we are not targeting any memmory so 0  
dependency.srcAccessMask = 0;  
  
//dependency end  
dependency.dstStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT|VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT;  
//we want to access colour attachemnt so that we can write to it  
dependency.dstAccessMask= VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT | VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT;
```

Since we have load operation to be cleared we have specified to access the mask for writes

## Frame buffer modification

Next we have to inform frame buffer to also write the depth data. Therefore we will go to the `CreateFrameBuffers` method and modify the creation like so.

This will bind the actual `VkImageView` where depth is stored to the frame buffer so that it can written to and accessed 

```c++
for(size_t i=0; i<m_swapChainImageViews.size(); i++) {  
    std::array<VkImageView,2> attachments = {  
        m_swapChainImageViews[i],  
        m_depthImageView  
    };  
    VkFramebufferCreateInfo frameBufferInfo{};  
    frameBufferInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FRAMEBUFFER_CREATE_INFO;  
    frameBufferInfo.renderPass = m_renderPass;  
    frameBufferInfo.attachmentCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(attachments.size());  
    frameBufferInfo.pAttachments = attachments.data();  
    frameBufferInfo.width = m_swapChainExtent.width;  
    frameBufferInfo.height = m_swapChainExtent.height;  
    frameBufferInfo.layers = 1;
```

>NOTE: The colour attachment is different for each swap chain image, but we can use single depth image since only one sub pass is running at the time due to the seamphores

## Clearing values

Since now we have multiple attachments that have `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR` as they loading operator we have to specify to what value we want them to be cleared.

This is done while recording the render pass by first creating the array of `VkClearValue`

```c++
std::array<VkClearValue, 2> clearValues{};  
clearValues[0].color ={{0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}};  
clearValues[1].depthStencil = {1.0f, 0};
//...
renderPassInfo.clearValueCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(clearValues.size());  
renderPassInfo.pClearValues = clearValues.data();
```

In Vulkan depth ranges from 0 to 1. Where 1 is the furthest possible value an 0 is the nearest possible value. Note that the order of the array should match the order of the attachments

## Configuring pipeline

At this point the depth and stencil values are ready to be used, however the depth and stencil testing needs to be enabled in the graphics pipeline by filling in the `VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo` struct

```c++
//-----------------------  
// DEPTH AND STENCIL TEST  
//-----------------------  
VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo depthStencil{  
    .sType =  VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_INFO};  
depthStencil.depthTestEnable = VK_TRUE;  
//should fragments that pass the depht test be written to the frame buffer ?  
depthStencil.depthWriteEnable = VK_TRUE;  
//fragemnts pass the depht test if their value is smaller than value allredy written in depth buffer  
depthStencil.depthCompareOp = VK_COMPARE_OP_LESS;  
//allows us to keep only fragments that fall within specific range  
depthStencil.depthBoundsTestEnable = VK_FALSE;  
depthStencil.minDepthBounds = 0.0f;  
depthStencil.maxDepthBounds = 1.0f;  
  
depthStencil.stencilTestEnable = VK_FALSE;  
depthStencil.front = {};  
depthStencil.back = {};
```

Now we can update the pipeline itself by passing this struct to the `pipelineInfo.pDepthStencilState`

```c++
pipelineInfo.pMultisampleState = &multisampleCreateInfo;  
pipelineInfo.pDepthStencilState = &depthStencil;  //here
pipelineInfo.pColorBlendState = &colourBlendCreateInfo;
```

## Handling window resize

Depth buffer should resize together with the colour buffer so we need to take care of this.
We will go to the `RecreateSwapChain` method and extend it to also recreate the depth buffer

```c++
void VulkanApp::RecreateSwapChain() {  
  
    int width = 0, height = 0;  
    glfwGetFramebufferSize(m_window, &width, &height);  
    while(width == 0 || height == 0) {  
        m_appNotifier.appStatus = IDLE;  
        m_appNotifier.isDirty = true;  
        glfwGetFramebufferSize(m_window, &width, &height);  
        glfwWaitEvents();  
    }  
  
    vkDeviceWaitIdle(m_device);  
  
    CleanupSwapChain();  
  
    CreateSwapChain();  
    CreateImageViews();  
    CreateDepthResources();  
    CreateFrameBuffers();  
}
```

And lastly we should modify the `CleanUpSwapChain` method to delete all of the created buffers and allocated memory 

```c++
void VulkanApp::CleanupSwapChain() {  
    for (auto frameBuffer: m_swapChainFrameBuffers) {  
        vkDestroyFramebuffer(m_device, frameBuffer, nullptr);  
    }  
  
    for (auto imageView: m_swapChainImageViews) {  
        vkDestroyImageView(m_device, imageView, nullptr);  
    }  
  
  
    vkDestroyImageView(m_device,m_depthImageView, nullptr);  
    vkDestroyImage(m_device, m_depthImage, nullptr);  
    vkFreeMemory(m_device, m_depthMemory, nullptr);
    
```
