Depth testing is related t removing pixels that are covered by other objects, this is done through something called *depth testing* where resterizer checks the depth value of the pixel that is currently being rendered against the pixel that is already stored in. If the depth of new pixel is smaller than this pixel is behind some other geometry and therefore gets discarded, meaning depth test has failed. 

To trigger the depth test we have to render another plane on top of the one that we currently have.

```c++
const std::vector<Vertex> planeVertices = {  
    {{-0.5f, 0.0f, -0.5f}, {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f}}, // Bottom-left  
    {{0.5f, 0.0f, -0.5f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 0.0f}}, // Bottom-right  
    {{0.5f, 0.0f, 0.5f}, {0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f}}, // Top-right  
    {{-0.5f, 0.0f, 0.5f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f}}, // Top-left  
  
    {{-0.5f, -0.5f, -0.5f}, {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f}},  
    {{0.5f, -0.5f, -0.5f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 0.0f}},  
    {{0.5f, 0.5f, -0.5f}, {0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f}},  
    {{-0.5f, 0.5f, -0.5f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f}}  
};  
  
const std::vector<uint32_t> planeIndices = {  
    0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0,  
    4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 4  
};
```

This will cause the object that should be hidden by another object to be drawn on top of it. This can be solved by either sorting the draw calls based depth value or use the above mentioned depth test. The second option is used most of the times.

Depth buffer is another attachment where we can render into, just like colour. And as colour we can modify this value with fragment shader.

In OpenGL the depth ranges from -1 to 1 in Vulkan the **depth range is 0 - 1** so we need to configure the `glm::prespective` matrix to account for that by defining following.

```c++
#define GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE;
```
