We will create a shader storage buffer that will hold array of particles which we can manipulate directly on the GPU. 

We will have to duplicate this so that CPU and GPU stay busy during frame rendering. Since we use frames in flight CPU can pass the altered data to the *vertex shader* while compute shader is manipulating the new batch of particle data.

We will create the `std::vector` of `VkBuffer` and back it up with `VkDeviceMemory`

```c++
std::vector<VkBuffer> m_shaderStorageBuffer;  
std::vector<VkDeviceMemory> m_shaderStorageBufferMemory;
```

Next we can create the particle struct that will hold the information about each particle 

```c++
struct Particle {  
    glm::vec2 position;  
    glm::vec2 velocity;  
    glm::vec4 color;  
};
```

Now in `CreateShaderStorageBuffer` (we have to create it) method we will resize the buffer and storage to match the maximum number of frame in flight 

```c++
void VulkanApp::CreateShaderStorageBuffer() {  
    m_shaderStorageBuffer.resize(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);  
    m_shaderStorageBufferMemory.resize(MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);
    
```

Now we will generate the position of the particle on the screen, randomly scatter it around the circle and give it random colour

```c++
// Cretes random values between 0 and 1 with time as a seed  
std::default_random_engine rndEngine((unsigned) time(nullptr));  
std::uniform_real_distribution<float> rndDist(0.0f, 1.0f);  
  
std::vector<Particle> particles(PARTICLE_COUNT);  
for(auto& particle: particles) {  
    float radius  = 0.25f*sqrt(rndDist(rndEngine));  
    //scatter around entire circle  
    float theta = rndDist(rndEngine)* 2 * 3.14159265358979323846;  
    //from angle and radius to x and y  
    float x = radius * cos(theta) * HEIGHT / WIDTH;  
    float y = radius * sin (theta);  
  
    particle.position = glm::vec2(x,y);  
    particle.velocity = glm::normalize(glm::vec2(x,y))*0.00025f;  
    particle.color=glm::vec4(rndDist(rndEngine),rndDist(rndEngine),rndDist(rndEngine),1.0f);
```

We can now create the staging buffer in CPU memory (host memory) to hold the **initial** particle positions

```c++
VkDeviceSize stagingBufferSize = PARTICLE_COUNT * sizeof(Particle);  
  
VkBuffer stagingBuffer;  
VkDeviceMemory stagingBufferMemory;  
BufferCreateInfo bufferCreateInfo;  
bufferCreateInfo.physicalDevice = m_physicalDevice;  
bufferCreateInfo.logicalDevice = m_device;  
bufferCreateInfo.surface = m_sruface;  
bufferCreateInfo.size = stagingBufferSize;  
bufferCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT;  
bufferCreateInfo.properties = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT;  
CreateBuffer(bufferCreateInfo, stagingBuffer, stagingBufferMemory);  
  
void* data;  
vkMapMemory(m_device, stagingBufferMemory, 0, stagingBufferSize, 0, &data);  
memcpy(data, particles.data(),(size_t)stagingBufferSize);
```

We now have initial data of particles i the GPU, we will now copy this data from staging buffer to the actual SSBO. Remember, that we have to copy data to every buffer that is going to be required for the current frame in flight and we can not write to the same buffer that we are reading from at the same time. 

```c++
for(size_t i=0; i<MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT; i++) {  
    //note the last bit flag, it is converting the buffer to be SSBO  
    bufferCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT;  
    bufferCreateInfo.properties = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT;  
    CreateBuffer(bufferCreateInfo, m_shaderStorageBuffer[i], m_shaderStorageBufferMemory[i]);  
    // copy from staging buffer to the acctual buffer on the GPU that acts like and SSBO  
    CopyBuffer(m_device,m_transferQueue, m_transferCommandPool, stagingBuffer, m_shaderStorageBuffer[i], stagingBufferSize);  
}
```
