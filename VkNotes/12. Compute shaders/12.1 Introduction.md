Any computationally expensive work that is done on CPU can be done on GPU with use of compute shaders. 
Compute shaders are available on every Vulkan implementation.

It can be used for graphics stuff like, advanced lightning, physics simulation, particles and animations. Additionally it can be used with not graphical output whatsoever, this is called headless computing.

## Advantages
- offloads CPU 
- data does not need to be stored and passed onto the GPU but can be only on GPU instead.
- highly paralleled

## Vulkan pipeline

![[Images/Vulkan compute pipeline.png]]

On the right we can see the *compute stage*. It can be called from anywhere in the application unlike for example *Fragment shader* that can only be called on the transformed output of the vertex shader. On top of that compute shader can use descriptors to pass data into it.

## Example

We will implement particle system containing a lot of particles that needs to be update at 60 fps with some equation. We will use the Vertex array to pass the vertices of the particles and update them using compute shader.

On CPU this is done by updating the buffer of vertex positions and sending them to the GPU which is costly and not efficient. This means that we have to traverse back and forth between CPU and GPU. 

This is avoided when all of the data are stored on GPU and passed there once (at the beginning)


## Data manipulation

As mentioned we were mostly sending data to GPU by mapping it to the CPU memory. This is however changed in compute buffers as they allow us to **read** and **write** to buffers created for this purpose.

Vulkan offers 2 solutions 
### Shader storage buffer object (SSBO)

Shader Storage Buffer Objects (SSBOs) function similarly to Uniform Buffer Objects (UBOs) in that they enable shaders to read from and write to a buffer. The primary differences are that SSBOs can be treated as other buffer types, and they can be arbitrarily large, unlike UBOs, which have a size limitation.

As an exmaple we will use the particle system, since buffers needs to be written to by compute shader and read by vertex shader one might think that it requires different buffer types. Lets say SSBO for compute shader and VAO for vertex shader. **But it is not like that**. 
While creating such buffer we can specify that it will have multiple usage.

```c++
bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT |
VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT |
VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;
```

Note that for the buffer usage we have specified that it will be used as a vertex buffer for vertex shader and as a store buffer for the compute shader. On top of that we have used `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT` since we also need to fill it with some data at the beginning.

If we want to access such buffer in the code it would look like this 

```glsl
struct Particle {
	vec2 position;

	vec2 velocity;

	vec4 color;
};

 layout(std140, binding = 1) readonly buffer ParticleSSBOIn {
	Particle particlesIn[ ];
};

layout(std140, binding = 2) buffer ParticleSSBOOut {
	Particle particlesOut[ ];
};
```

### Images 

Compute shaders can be used on images to apply for example a post processing effects.

If we want to use images inside compute shader we can change the image usage parameter to be `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT` and `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT`. This will tell the implementation that we want to use image for 2 different reasons, namely for reading it by the shader and storing data into it by the compute shader

To use the shader inside the shader we can access it similarly to the SSBO

```glsl
// only for reading
layout (binding = 0, rgba8) uniform readonly image2D inputImage;

//only for writing
layout (binding = 1, rgba8) uniform writeonly image2D outputImage;
```

> NOTE: the image type is no longer `sampler2D` but `image2D` instead

If we want to access write or read the image we would use the following code 

```glsl
vec3 pixel = imageLoad(inputImage,

ivec2(gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy)).rgb;

imageStore(outputImage, ivec2(gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy), pixel);
```
