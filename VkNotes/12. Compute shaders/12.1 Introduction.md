Any computationally expensive work that is done on CPU can be done on GPU with use of compute shaders. 
Compute shaders are available on every Vulkan implementation.

It can be used for graphics stuff like, advanced lightning, physics simulation, particles and animations. Additionally it can be used with not graphical output whatsoever, this is called headless computing.

## Advantages
- offloads CPU 
- data does not need to be stored and passed onto the GPU but can be only on GPU instead.
- highly paralleled

## Vulkan pipeline

On the right we can see the *compute stage*. It can be called from anywhere in the application unlike for example *Fragment shader* that can only be called on the transformed output of the vertex shader. On top of that compute shader can use descriptors to pass data into it.

## Example

We will implement particle system containing a lot of particles that needs to be update at 60 fps with some equation. We will use the Vertex array to pass the vertices of the particles and update them using compute shader.

On CPU this is done by updating the buffer of vertex positions and sending them to the GPU which is costly and not efficient. This means that we have to traverse back and forth between CPU and GPU. 

This is avoided when all of the data are stored on GPU and passed there once (at the beginning)
