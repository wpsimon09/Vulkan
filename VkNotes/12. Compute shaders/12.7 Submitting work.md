Since we are going to be using compute pipeline and graphics pipeline we are going to be submitting work to both the compute queue and graphics queue.

We will first submit the compute queue to update the particle positions and than use the graphics queue to draw the updated positions. 

In order to do that it is **crucial** to have right synchronisation in place. 
The commands **are guaranteed** to **start** in the **right order** however they might end in different, therefore we have to use semaphores and fences to synchronise the work correctly 

We will try to prevent the following cases

- vertex shader draws when compute shader is not done updating 
- compute shader updates particles that are still in use by the vertex shader 

We will create 2 new semaphores and 2 fences (one per each frame in flight) in order to synchronise the work correctly
