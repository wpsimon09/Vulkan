Since compute is using different pipeline than the graphics one we have to use separate command and not the `vkCreateGraphicsPipline`. To create compute pipeline we will use `vkCreateComputePipeline`. Since it is not registering anything, or displaying anything to the screen its setup is much easier and straight forward. 

```c++
void VulkanApp::CreateComputePipeline() {  
    auto computeShaderCode = readFile("Shaders/Compiled/ParticlesCompute.spv");  
    VkShaderModule computeShaderModule = createShaderModuel(m_device, computeShaderCode);  
  
    VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo computeShaderStageInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_INFO};  
    computeShaderStageInfo.stage = VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT;  
    computeShaderStageInfo.module = computeShaderModule;  
    computeShaderStageInfo.pName = "main";  
    computeShaderStageInfo.pName = nullptr;  
    computeShaderStageInfo.pSpecializationInfo = nullptr;  
  
    VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo computePipelineLayout{.sType =  VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_LAYOUT_CREATE_INFO};  
    computePipelineLayout.pSetLayouts = &m_computeDescryptorSetLayout;  
    computePipelineLayout.setLayoutCount  =1 ;  
    if(vkCreatePipelineLayout(m_device, &computePipelineLayout, nullptr, &m_computePipelineLayout) != VK_SUCCESS)  
    {  
        throw std::runtime_error("Failed to create pipeline layout !");  
    }  
  
    VkComputePipelineCreateInfo computePipelineInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMPUTE_PIPELINE_CREATE_INFO};  
    computePipelineInfo.layout = m_computePipelineLayout;  
    computePipelineInfo.stage =
```

## Compute space 

It is defined by the **work group** and **invocation** in 3 dimensional space. This is just an abstract model to help us better understand the compute operations. 

**Work groups** those are work items that needs to be processed by the GPU. Its dimensions are set during command buffer invocation. 

Work group is collections of **invocations**. They execute the same compute shared. They can run in parallel and their **dimensions are set in the compute shader**. Additionally, they have access to the SSBO and shared memory
