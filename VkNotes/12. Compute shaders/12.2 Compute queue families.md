The queue family that we are going to be looking for is using `VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT` flag. This means that we will need to obtain queue from this queue family.

Vulkan implementation must implement at least 1 queue family that supports both compute and graphics. But sometimes there might be queue family that supports **only the compute operations**. If that is the case we could use asynchronous compute which is involved and advanced topic not covered here. Vulkan documentation about queue families [here](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/performance/async_compute/README.html)

To retrieve the right queue family (and queue after it) we will change the creation of the logical device.
