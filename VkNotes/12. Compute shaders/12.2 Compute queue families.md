The queue family that we are going to be looking for is using `VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT` flag. This means that we will need to obtain queue from this queue family.

Vulkan implementation must implement at least 1 queue family that supports both compute and graphics. But sometimes there might be queue family that supports **only the compute operations**. If that is the case we could use asynchronous compute which is involved and advanced topic not covered here. Vulkan documentation about queue families [here](https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/performance/async_compute/README.html)

To retrieve the right queue family (and queue after it) we will change the creation of the logical device. 

```c++
if ((queueFamily.queueFlags & VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT)&& (queueFamily.queueFlags & VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT)) {  
    indices.graphicsAndComputeFamily = i;  
}
```

We have renamed the `queueFamily` in `QueueFamilyIndices` struct for better naming

We will now retrieve the compute handler and store it for future reference.

```c++
vkGetDeviceQueue(m_device, indices.graphicsAndComputeFamily.value(), 0, &m_computeQueue);
```

## Compute shader stage

The compute shaders are created the same way we have create fragment and vertex shader. When we want to pass data by means of descriptors or bind the pipeline itself we will have to use `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE`. Here are some examples where we used `VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS`, those examples are scattered through the code.   

```c++
vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(commandBuffer, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, m_pipelineLayout, 0, 1, &m_descriptorSets[currentFrame], 0, nullptr);

vkCmdBindPipeline(commandBuffer, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, m_graphicsPipeline);

subPass.pipelineBindPoint = VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS;
```

## Loading compute shaders

It is exactly the same as with other shaders but with difference that we will use `VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT`

```c++
auto computeShaderCode = readFile("Shaders/Compiled/ParticlesCompute.spv");

VkShaderModule computeShaderModule = createShaderModuel(m_device, computeShaderCode);

VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo computeShaderStageInfo{.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_INFO};  
computeShaderStageInfo.stage = VK_SHADER_STAGE_COMPUTE_BIT;  
computeShaderStageInfo.module = computeShaderModule;  
computeShaderStageInfo.pName = "main";  
computeShaderStageInfo.pName = nullptr;
computeShaderStageInfo.pSpecializationInfo = nullptr;
```
