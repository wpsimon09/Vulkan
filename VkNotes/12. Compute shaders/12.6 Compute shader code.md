Compute shaders use the the same syntax and langue as fragment and vertex shader.  

this is how we can specify simple compute shader 

```glsl
#version 460  
  
// unifrom buffer objrect at binding 0  
layout(binding = 0) uniform ParameterUBOb{  
    float deltaTime;  
}ubo;  
  
//same as in c++ side  
struct Particle{  
    vec2 position;  
    vec2 velocity;  
    vec4 color;  
};  
  
// SSBO in  
layout(std140, binding = 1) readonly buffer ParticleSSBOIn{  
    Particle particlesIn[];  
};  
  
// SSBO out (here we will wrtie)  
layout(std140, binding = 2) readonly buffer ParticleSSBOOut{  
    Particle particlesOut[];  
};  
  
//dimension of the invocation  
layout (local_size_x = 256, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;  
  
void main() {  
//retrieve the index of the work group at the x dimensions since we only have linear array
    uint index = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;  
    Particle particleIn = particlesIn[index];  
    particlesOut[index].position = particleIn.position + particleIn.velocity.xy * ubo.deltaTime;  
    particlesOut[index].velocity = particleIn.velocity;  
}
```

`layout (local_size_x = 256, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;` this specifies number of invocations in the compute shader, meaning that this compute shader will get executed 256 times and each execution the `gl_GlobalInvocationID` gets updated . Since we only have one linear array of particles we are focused on `x` axis if we were to use for example images we would specify `x` and `y` axes in order to process width and high of the image concurrently

## Running compute shader

We now have to invoke the compute shader with desired number of invocations using `vkCmdDispatch` command that is passed to the command buffer. We can think of it as `vkCmdDraw` that executes the draw commands.
