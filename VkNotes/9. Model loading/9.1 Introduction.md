We will use `tiny_obj_loader.h` to load .obj files.

We need to download that file, and create `c++` version of it with the following contents

```c++
#define TINYOBJLOADER_IMPLEMENTATION  
#include <tiny_obj_loader/tiny_obj_loader.h>
```

We should also change the type of the vertices from `uint16_t` to `uint32_t` but I have already done this in the [[Appendix A - PBR Sphere]] 

## Loading model

To load the model we will call the `tinyobj::LoadObj` 

```c++
//contains vertices, normals, uv all packed together  
tinyobj::attrib_t attrib;  
//contains all of the objects and their faces by keeping the index of the vertices loaded above  
std::vector<tinyobj::shape_t>shapes;  
//materials and textures per face  
std::vector<tinyobj::material_t>materials;  
std::string warn, err;  
  
if(!tinyobj::LoadObj(&attrib, &shapes, &materials,&warn, &err, MODEL_PATH.c_str())) {  
    throw std::runtime_error(warn + err);  
}
```

We will squash everything together to the one vertex array so we will loop through all of the shapes

```c++
for(const auto& shape: shapes) {  
    for(const auto& index: shape.mesh.indices) {  
        Vertex vertex{};  
        vertices.push_back(vertex);  
        indices.push_back(indices.size());  
    }  
}
```

For now we will assume that every vertex is unique, and thus not use indices (we will fix it later)

The `index` (iterator) contains `vertex_index`, `normal_index`, `texcoord_index`. We will use those to look up the actual vertex value inside the `attrib` variable.

Since the vertices are in the array we have to calculate the accrual start of the vertex position. This means that we are multiplying by 3 to get the start of the vertex and addition by 0 , 1, 2 is retrieving the actual vertex values.

We will do the same for the uv coordinates but we will use times 2 to get the starting point of the objects 

```c++
for(const auto& shape: shapes) {  
    for(const auto& index: shape.mesh.indices) {  
        Vertex vertex{};  
  
        vertex.pos= {  
            attrib.vertices[3*index.vertex_index + 0],  
            attrib.vertices[3*index.vertex_index + 1],  
            attrib.vertices[3*index.vertex_index + 2]  
        };  
  
        vertex.uv = {  
            attrib.texcoords[2*index.texcoord_index + 0],  
            1 - attrib.texcoords[2*index.texcoord_index + 1]  
        };  
  
        vertex.normal ={  
            attrib.normals[3*index.normal_index + 0],  
            attrib.normals[3*index.normal_index + 1],  
            attrib.normals[3*index.normal_index + 2],  
        };  
  
        vertex.color = {1.0,1.0,1.0};  
  
        vertices.push_back(vertex);  
        indices.push_back(indices.size());  
    }
```

## Vertex duplication

To keep track of the vertices we will use `unordered map` where we will have the vertex and its index

```c++
//is the vertex unique ?  
if(uniqueVetices.count(vertex) == 0) {  
    //add its index  
    uniqueVetices[vertex] = static_cast<uint32_t>(vertices.size());  
    //add vertex itself  
    vertices.push_back(vertex);  
}else {  
    //store only index  
    indices.push_back(uniqueVetices[vertex]);  
}
```

Every time we read vertex we check if it exists in the created map if it does we will just push its index to the index array. If it was not seen we will push it back together with is index which is always incrementing by the size of vertices

Since we are using `Vertex` as a key and index as a value in the hash table we have to override the `==` operator **inside the Vertex** struct

```c++
bool operator == (const Vertex& other) const {  
    return pos==other.pos && color == other.color && uv == other.uv;  
}
```

Now we also have to implement hash function that will
