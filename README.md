Loaded simple **TIE Fighter 3D Model** by [metalmorag](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/avatar-of-metalmorag-7-1k-7119-downloads-25-7k-25661-views-188like-report-19a4deefbc2b4f0592c44b117249f3c1) Licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

Vertices, normals and texture coordinates are loaded with the help of [tiny-obj-loader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader) library

Model data are in the `.obj` file while separate textures are in `glTF` format. For now model and textures are loaded independently of each other
